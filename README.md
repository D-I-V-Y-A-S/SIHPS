## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
"Our platform, named 'EcoRecycle Hub,' is a user-friendly website designed to help individuals easily locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Beyond providing this vital service, we aim to educate users about the harmful impacts of improper e-waste disposal through interactive pop-ups and articles. Users can also input their old device models to learn about potential precious metal recovery and earn credits for responsible disposal. EcoRecycle Hub strives to empower users to make informed decisions and contribute to a cleaner, greener future."
